#  Just Eat – Food Delivery App (UI/UX Design)

This project is a *UI/UX prototype* of a conceptual food delivery application named *Just Eat, designed by me as part of a hands-on learning experience during a **UI/UX internship session. I used the knowledge gained to independently design an end-to-end app flow using tools like **Figma* and *YouCut*.
