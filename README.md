#  Just Eat – Food Delivery App 

*Just Eat* is a modern, minimalistic food delivery app UI designed to deliver a seamless and intuitive user experience. The project simulates a real-world application, covering user onboarding, food discovery, order customization, and checkout flows — crafted entirely using *Figma* as part of my UI/UX design learning experience.
